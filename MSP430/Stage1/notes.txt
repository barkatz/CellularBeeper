Choosing transistor to control the LCD power pin:
=================================================

Measured 28.6mA current consumption of the LCD screen (with max contrast).
-> Take into account max current consumption of 50mA.

LCD characteristics:
1. Supply voltage: 5V
2. Max current:    50mA

C1815 characteristics:
1. Ic/Ib = 10 (in saturation)
2. Ic up to 150mA
3. Vceo up to 50V
4. For Ic = 50mA, Vbesat = 0.85

MSP430 characteristics:
1. With Vcc 3V, when outputting 5mA, Vgpio is 2.75V
2. Looks like it's safe to put out 22mA, so we'll do our calculations as if to put out 10mA

Resistor characteristics:
1. We need Vgpio-Vbesat = 3V-0.85V = 2.15V to bo consumed by the resistor
2. With 10mA going through the base, this means we need a resistor with 2.15V/10mA = 215 Ohm ~ 200 Ohm
(Even in the case that the transistor has zero resistance, and Vgpio = Vcc, we will have a power consumption of only 3V/200Ohm = 15mA, which is OK).
